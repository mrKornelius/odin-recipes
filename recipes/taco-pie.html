      <li>1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent roll dough</li>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a large deep-dish pie pan with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Break ground beef into small pieces and add to hot skillet; cook and stir until the beef is crumbly and no longer pink, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Season drained beef with taco seasoning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press refrigerated dough into the bottom of the prepared pan. Spread refried beans in an even layer onto the dough. Spread sour cream into a layer atop the refried beans. Sprinkle ground beef evenly over the sour cream; top with salsa and Cheddar cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly and crust has browned, 25 to 30 minutes.
